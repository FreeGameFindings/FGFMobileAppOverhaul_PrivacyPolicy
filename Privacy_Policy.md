# Privacy Policy and Terms of Use
This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Free Game Findings for mobile devices that was created by StOoPiD_U (Cedric Pereira). This is an application that you can use to access the Free Game Findings database/backend which houses posts, comments, users and more. Eventually, it will allow you to enable notifications to be sent to your device too.

# Data Usage
This application sends and receives data from the Free Game Findings database/backend. You as a user may create an account, share posts, like/dislike things and make comments. These will be stored on the database. User details like email address, username and password are saved to the database. Passwords are encrypted with Django Rest Framework's encryption. This data is required to have accounts function. You can also get your account removed if you wish.

In the future there may be the inclusion of ads, which would likely send analytics to Google AdMob. That would be updated within this policy when that happens. It is also possible that affiliate links will be included which would credit purchases made after promotion within the application to me (Cedric Pereira/StOoPiD_U/Free Game Findings), which would be done through the use of cookies. This will be confirmed once implemented in this document.

# Content of the Free Game Findings Application
The content of the application is based on user submitted data that shares links to video game promotions. Some additional content will be provided from the publicly available data from the /r/FreeGameFindings subreddit. As a user you have the option to create an account to share posts, make comments, like/dislike things. The application does not require you to have any account to use it for basic viewing, but the links provided from the data may require such. The goal is to allow you to be redirected to the direct link of the promotions shared in the Free Game Findings post(s).

The posts include discussion or links to video games that can vary in age-range and in content. It is possible you may see inappropriate titles, or thumbnails on occasion, but can filter out NSFW content if you wish. It is also possible that user generated content or discussion could be deemed inappropriate too. Some user generated content accessible by clicking a link from the application may also be inappropriate.

Some settings you configure in the application will be stored on your local device. 

# Changes
This privacy policy can end up being updated. If that is the case, the new policy will be listed in this document here or relocated elsewhere but will be accessible on the store page(s) of this application. You are advised to consult this document for changes as continued use of the application is deemed approval of all of policy changes.
